# MPC control of quadcopter using Gaussian processes 
Implementation of MPC controller for a quadrocopter model using python. This repository implements the framework as described in [[1]](#1)

Using a python simulation, we tracked a trajectory using an MPC controller. The simulated quadcopter was subject to a quadratic air resistence term which the MPC prediction model does not have access to. This caused a difference between the predicted velocities and the actual velocities of the quadcopter. 

$$\hat{a}_{\text{error}} = \frac{v_{\text{true}}-v_{\text{pred}}}{\Delta t}$$


Using a [Gaussian process](https://github.com/smidmatej/Gaussian-process) regression, we can fit the acceleration error in axis x to a velocity in x (and for y and z too).

Since the MPC controller uses Acados for its predictions, to augment the prediction model with the Gaussian process, we implement a casadi version of Gaussian process regression. This also allows us to compute a symbolic derivative of the GP predictions w.r.t velocity.
